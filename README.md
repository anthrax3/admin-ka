# Admin-ka

It's a very simple ASP.Net Core GUI for internal adminstration.
Also there's a demo backend (on Node.js) for this GUI in DemoServer folder.

## Getting started

Just run `prepare-and-run.bat` batch, it will get all things ready and run both apps (client and server).
After that you could just go to http://localhost:5001.

If you want to run GUI on a different PC without all that (Requirements) installed you might use `dotnet publish --configuration Release` to create a portable artefact.

## Requirements

You must have installed Node.js, npm, bower and .Net Core SDK.
